*Art Gallery for Raluca Neferu

This is the first website I have coded. 

I used BEM methodology for the css code, with a couple of exceptions. 

I used em-defined, design-driven breakpoints for the media queries. 

I have not used any code that I have not written myself for this site. That means no Jquery, no Bootstrap, no vendor scripts or stylesheets (except for google fonts).

I have not commented my code, except in a couple of places, due to the personal nature of the site. Websites made for paying clients or employers, however, will be properly commented and easily maintainable.

An update is scheduled a couple of months from now to make the site compatible in Safari and responsive in older IE versions. 

A couple of UI improvements are also scheduled for a more distant update: 1) make the blog posts and about page vertically scrollable from any cursor position on the page, not just from inside the container div and 2) make the gallery slides switch back and forth by horizontal scrolling, not just click/touch events.

I hope you enjoy the website, and especially the artwork within it, at https://ralucaneferu.com/index.html.
